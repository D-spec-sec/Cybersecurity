In the context of a significant increase in the use of IoT devices, it is prudent to be concerned about multiple aspects of security. Each of the mentioned concerns (weak authentication mechanisms, data in motion protection, and patches deployment) plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of IoT devices and the overall network.

Weak authentication mechanisms: Weak authentication mechanisms can make IoT devices vulnerable to unauthorized access. However, it might not be the only concern, and other aspects like data protection and patches deployment are also crucial.

Data in motion protection: is an important aspect of IoT security. Often cheap IoT devices comes without any encryption mechanism out of the box.

Patches deployment: Patches deployment is indeed a critical concern to address vulnerabilities and ensure the security of IoT devices. However, focusing solely on patches deployment may overlook other important security aspects, such as authentication mechanisms or data protection.

Consider deploying IoT devices on a network distinct from your primary LAN. This approach involves setting up a separate network infrastructure specifically for IoT devices, which helps mitigate security risks and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity of your main LAN.
By segregating IoT devices onto a separate network, organizations can create a dedicated environment for these devices, reducing the attack surface and minimizing the potential impact of security breaches. 
This separation helps safeguard critical systems and data on the main LAN from potential threats originating from IoT devices, which may have weaker security measures or be more susceptible to exploitation.
Additionally, it allows for better network management and control, as well as easier monitoring and enforcement of security policies tailored specifically for IoT devices.
