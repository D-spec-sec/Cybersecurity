DNSSEC is designed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system, particularly against cache poisoning and DNS spoofing attacks. It provides a mechanism for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS data by digitally signing DNS records.
By implementing DNSSEC, your company can enhance the security of its DNS infrastructure and prevent attackers from manipulating DNS server caches to redirect traffic to malicious websites. How ?

DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a protective feature integrated into various DNS server software implementations. 
Operating within a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), DNSSEC employs digital signatures, offering a mechanism for DNS servers to verify the legitimacy of incoming messages. This validation process ensures that messages are not falsified or potentially malicious.

If DNSSEC is activated on a server, let's call it Server A, and a client initiates a DNS request for a resource not locally cached, Server A forwards the request to external DNS servers. 
Upon receiving a response, Server A scrutinizes the digital signature on the message. This verification step is crucial in confirming that the information originates from an authorized DNS server. Even if an attacker attempts to send a message to a DNS server, the server would dismiss it because the message lacks a valid digital signature.

In essence, DNSSEC empowers DNS servers to exclusively send and receive authenticated and authorized messages, creating a barrier against an attacker's attempt to compromise DNS cache tables through poisoning.
