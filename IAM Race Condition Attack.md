In cases where the authentication and authorization processes are separated into two distinct functions, there exists a potential vulnerability wherein an attacker might exploit a race condition to manipulate the sequence, forcing the completion of the authorization step before the authentication step.

In a secure system, authentication and authorization are two critical steps that usually occur sequentially. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It often involves validating credentials like usernames and passwords. 
Once authenticated, the next step is authorization, which determines what permissions or levels of access the authenticated user or system has.

However, if these two processes are separated into two distinct functions, a potential vulnerability could arise. An attacker might exploit a race condition to manipulate the sequence of these processes. A race condition is a situation in the system where the system’s behavior depends on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events.

In the context of authentication and authorization, an attacker could exploit a race condition to force the completion of the authorization step before the authentication step. This could potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions without proper authentication.

For example, if the system is designed such that once a request for access is made, it starts both the authentication and authorization processes, but does not adequately ensure that authentication completes before authorization, an attacker could take advantage of this. 
The attacker could try to influence the timing or sequence of operations to complete the authorization process before the system has fully authenticated the user.

This is why it’s crucial to design systems with security in mind from the ground up, and ensure that proper synchronization is in place when dealing with processes that need to occur in a specific order.
